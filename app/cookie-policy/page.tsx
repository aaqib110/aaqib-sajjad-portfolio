            <p>
              As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files
              that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information
              they gather, how I use it, and why I sometimes need to store these cookies. I will also share how you can
              prevent these cookies from being stored, however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the
              site's functionality.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How I Use Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              I use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry
              standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they
              add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need
              them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.

                  If you create an account with me, I will use cookies for the management of the signup process and
                  general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out, however, in some
                  cases, they may remain afterward to remember your site preferences when logged out.

                  I use cookies when you are logged in so that I can remember this fact. This prevents you from having
                  to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when
                  you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.

              In some special cases, I also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details

                This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solutions on
                the web for helping me to understand how you use the site and ways that I can improve your experience.
                These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so I
                can continue to produce engaging content.
              </li>
              <li>
                From time to time, I test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered.
                When I am still testing new features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent
                experience whilst on the site whilst ensuring I understand which optimizations our users appreciate the
                most.

              Hopefully, that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that
              you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does
              interact with one of the features you use on my site.
