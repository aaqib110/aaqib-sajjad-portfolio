            <p>
              I may collect personal identification information from users in various ways, including, but not limited

              features, or resources I make available on my site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email
              address, and phone number. Users may, however, visit my site anonymously. I will collect personal
              identification information from users only if they voluntarily submit such information to me. Users can
              always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging

              Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and technical
              information about users' means of connection to my site, such as the operating system and the Internet
              service providers utilized and other similar information.

              My site may use "cookies" to enhance user experience. Users' web browsers place cookies on their hard

              their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that
              some parts of the site may not function properly.
